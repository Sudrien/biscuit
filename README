Biscuit

Making cookies more accessable within the Prototype JavaScript Framework
http://github.com/sudrien/biscuit

--

Normally, cookies are availble as a monolithic string. Biscuit makes
cookies accessible as a hash. It has been tested with Prototype 1.6.1
so far.

--

Usage:
document.cookies().get('cookie_index')
document.cookies().set('cookie_index','value')

--

Todo:
- confirm deleting cookies works as expected
- derive scope from linking page, if unspecified
- test for proper scope
- max-age/expires switching (int vs date)
- test in IE & Webkit
- document updated set function
