Making cookies more accessable within the Prototype JavaScript Framework
http://github.com/sudrien/biscuit

--

Normally, cookies are availble as a monolithic string. Biscuit makes
cookies accessible as a hash. It has been tested with Prototype 1.6.1
so far.

--

Usage:
document.cookies().get('cookie_index');
document.cookies().unset('cookie_index');
document.cookies().set('cookie_index','value', {params});

Supported params
expires: date. Converted to max-age. Overridden by max-age.
max_age: integer. Time in second until cookie expires. If not set, cookie expires when browser closes.
path: string. No paths outside this will have access to cookie.
domain: string. No subdomains outside this will have access to cookie. 
secure: boolean. If true, only send on https requests.

--

Todo:
- derive scope from linking page, if unspecified
- test for proper scope
- test in IE & Webkit
