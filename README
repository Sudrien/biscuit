Biscuit

Extending cookies with the Prototype JavaScript Framework
http://github.com/sudrien/biscuit

Normally, document.cookie is a string. Biscuit, as of now, makes it accessible as a hash.

Usage:


document.cookies().get('cookie_index')
document.cookies().set('cookie_index','value')


This has been tested with Prototype 1.6.1
